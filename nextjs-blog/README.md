Quick Overview of Next.js
Before we dive into setting up and deploying a Next.js application, let's take a moment to understand what Next.js is, why it's used, and its common use cases. This overview will give you a solid foundation and help you appreciate the capabilities of Next.js.

What is Next.js?
Next.js is a popular open-source framework built on top of React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developed and maintained by Vercel, Next.js provides a robust set of features that enhance the development experience and streamline the process of building web applications.

Why Use Next.js?
Next.js is designed to make it easier to create fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. Here are some key benefits of using Next.js:

Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js supports server-side rendering out of the box. This means that web pages are generated on the server for each request, improving initial load times and making the application more SEO-friendly.

Static Site Generation (SSG): Next.js allows you to pre-render pages at build time, creating static HTML files. This results in faster load times and improved performance, as static files can be served directly by a CDN.

API Routes: Next.js includes a built-in API routing system, allowing you to create serverless functions and API endpoints within the same project. This makes it easy to handle backend logic without needing a separate server.

File-Based Routing: Next.js uses a file-based routing system, where the file structure of the pages directory determines the application's routes. This simplifies navigation and routing within the application.

Built-In CSS and Sass Support: Next.js supports importing CSS and Sass files, allowing you to style your application easily. It also has built-in support for CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components.

Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits your code into smaller chunks, loading only the necessary JavaScript for the current page. This improves load times and overall performance.

Common Use Cases
Next.js is versatile and can be used for a variety of web applications. Some common use cases include:

Static Websites: Perfect for blogs, landing pages, and portfolio sites where content doesn't change frequently. Static Site Generation (SSG) makes these sites incredibly fast.

E-Commerce Sites: Next.js's server-side rendering (SSR) capabilities ensure that product pages load quickly and are optimized for search engines, improving user experience and SEO.

Corporate Websites: Companies use Next.js to build scalable, high-performance websites that need to handle large amounts of traffic and provide a seamless user experience.

Web Applications: From simple dashboards to complex web apps, Next.js's built-in API routes and server-side rendering capabilities make it a great choice for developing dynamic web applications.

Blogs and Content Sites: With Markdown and MDX support, Next.js is ideal for creating content-driven sites that are easy to maintain and SEO-friendly.

Summary
Next.js is a powerful framework that extends React's capabilities, making it easier to build fast, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. Whether you're creating a static site, a dynamic web app, or an e-commerce platform, Next.js provides the tools and features you need to deliver a great user experience.

Next Steps
With this understanding of Next.js, you're ready to start the application preparation. In the next part of our lesson, you will:

Create a GitHub repository for your project.
Clone the Next.js portfolio starter kit.
Record a Loom video explaining the code structure and add the link to your README file.
These steps will set the stage for deploying your Next.js application on AWS using Terraform. Let's get started!

Step 1: Prepare the next.js application

1.1 Create a GitHub Repository
Create a New GitHub Repository:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository named terraform-portfolio-project.
Initialize the repository with a README file.
2. Clone the Repository:

 git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/terraform-portfolio-project.git
 cd terraform-portfolio-project

1.2 Clone the Next.js Portfolio Starter Kit
Clone the Portfolio Starter Kit:

npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/basics/learn-starter"

Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd blog
npm run dev
This should start your next.js app on http://localhost:3000/
 

 
In the root of your folder, create a new file called next.config.js
Past this code in

/**
* @type {import('next').NextConfig}
*/
const nextConfig = {
 output: 'export',
 
  
}
 
module.exports = nextConfig
 
Then run export on your build: npm run build

It should generate an out folder.
 
 

Initialize Git and Push to GitHub:

git init git add . git commit -m "Initial commit of Next.js portfolio starter kit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/terraform-portfolio-project.git
git push -u origin master
1.3 Create a Loom Video
Create a Loom Video:

Record a Loom video explaining the Next.js code and the structure of the project.
Cover key files and folders such as pages, components, and public.
Add Loom Video Link to README:

Edit the README.md file in your GitHub repository to include the Loom video link.
Push the Changes to GitHub:

git add README.md git commit -m "Add Loom video link" git push
Step 2: Set Up Terraform Configuration

Create Terraform Directory:

mkdir terraform-nextjs
cd terraform-nextjs
Create Terraform Files:

1. State File with S3 + DynamoDB

2. Main.tf that includes your AWS provider block

3. Create your AWS S3 Bucket Resource with the following properties:

bucket
website 
index_document - index.html
error_document - index.html
tags 
4. Create your AWS S3 Bucket Policy Resource with the following properties:

bucket
Policy
version
statement
effect
principal
action
resource
5. Create your AWS CloudFront Distribution with the following properties:

origin
domain_name = s3 bucket
origin_id = s3-website
enabled 
default_root_object = "index.html"
default_cache_behavior 
allowed_methods = ["GET", "HEAD"] cached_methods = ["GET", "HEAD"] target_origin_id = "S3-Website"
forwarded_values
query_string = false
cookies { forward = "none"}
viewer_protocol_policy = "redirect-to-https"
Viewer_certificate
cloudfront_default_certificate = true
restrictions
georestriction
restriction_type = none
tags
 

For all of these double check the format, and how to create these properties and syntax on terraform AWS documentation.

6. Create outputs.tf file

output = bucket name with value your s3 bucket website
output = cloudfront_url with cloudfront distribution domain name 
7. Initialise terraform

8. Terraform Plan

9. Did it work? any issues?

10. Resolve and issues, run terraform plan again

11. Terraform Apply

Step 4: Upload the Next.js Static Site to S3
aws s3 sync ../blog/out s3://my-static-website-ss

Make sure you are feeding the right path... and s3:// is your S3 bucket name

Step 5: Access the Deployed Website
Get the CloudFront URL:

terraform output cloudfront_url
Access the Website: Open the CloudFront URL in your web browser to view the deployed Next.js portfolio site.
